          We facilitate open access to the alert data by making it available
          through multiple channels and in multiple formats. Our cloud-based
          broker is flexible and modularized, with access hooks at multiple
          stages of the pipeline so that users can access the data at any
          stage from raw to processed, value-added, and/or filtered.
          We provide the data in two formats: live alert streams (filtered
          and unfiltered) and long-term databases. Our filtering options
          include both predefined filters (based on our object classifications
          and basic properties of the raw data) and custom, user-defined
          filters to support the analysis of advanced users.
      </p>

          Our Google cloud implementation also makes it easier for users to
          create, deploy, and manage their analysis pipelines in astronomy's
          big-data era. Users have access to Google's scalable,
          high-performance compute resources at the location of the data
          eliminating the need for individual users to manage the bandwidth
          and storage resources and complicated server environments required
          for sophisticated analysis of large datasets.
